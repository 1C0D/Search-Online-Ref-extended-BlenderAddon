# Search-Online-Ref-modified-by-1-C0D

* you can find the original script (there)[https://github.com/tin2tin/Search-API-Reference/blob/master/search_api_reference.py] but I added the possibility to search from console too
* and I simplified the function to search and get some selected text. this is much simpler and working in evry situations (no more problem with multilines with crossing indexes...)  
so if you are doing a script around text editor can help you
