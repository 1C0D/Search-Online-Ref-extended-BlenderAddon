# Search-Online-Ref-modified-by-1-C0D

* this is a script I modified to search from text editor, or console, or info (in context menu) a selected text on API, github, python, stack exchange
  
Tips: 
- in text editor if no selection it will select the word under the cursor (same in console but less useful...)
- you can have too no selection to use this as a quick shortcut to the site

* you can find the original script [there](https://github.com/tin2tin/Search-API-Reference/blob/master/search_api_reference.py)
